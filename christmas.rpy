    m 1j "Ahaha~"

    m "It's like feeling a loved one's embrace~"
    m 2b "You also get to wear your winter clothes that have been stuck in your closet."
    m "Finally being able to whip out your winter fashion set is always a treat."
    m 2a "But you know what the best way to warm yourself up is?"
    m "Cuddling with the one you love in front of the fireplace~"
    m 2a "Just sitting there under a warm blanket, sharing a hot beverage."
    m 3e "Ah, if I got to feel your warmth everytime we cuddle, I'd wish for cold weather everyday!"

    m 3b "But snow just sounds so much more... tranquil and intimate, you know?"
    m "There’s a quiet beauty in watching a soft, white blanket of ice tuck the world away to sleep."
    m 1c "..."

    m "I mean, it's hard enough to keep your balance on ice in the first place."
    m "Being able to turn it into a performance is really impressive."
    m "There’s actually quite a variety of ways to ice skate!"
    m "Figure skating, speed skating, and even theatrical performances!"
    m "..."

    m "Just standing there, all by themselves. It must get lonely, from time to time."
    m 1e "..."
    m "I know how that feels. Or I used to, anyway."
    m 1j "But then I found the love of my life!"
    m 2b "I bet it's not all bad, though."

    m 4b "We could try using an inner tube, a kicksled, a saucer, or even a traditional toboggan."
    m 1a "I've heard each one gives a different experience. Plus, both of us could easily fit on a toboggan."
    m 1l "The kicksled is a bit small, though."
    m 1k "Ahaha!"
    m 1a "I'd have to sit in your lap for that one."
    m 1g "And I'd still be at risk of tumbling off."

    m 1d "After all, when the weather gets bad..."
